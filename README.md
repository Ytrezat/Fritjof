Hnefatafl games review software

*************************************
If you have troubles with the display (bad resolution), go to compatibility properties of the executable and modify the PPP parameters to let the application control the scaling of the window display.

How to import games played at http://aagenielsen.dk:
1/ Find your game in the archive
2/ Click on "list"
3/ Copy the sequence of moves in a .txt file, e.g.:
1.     	h1-h3     	e7-c7    
2.     	k5-i5     	g7-i7    
3.     	k8-k9     	f8-b8    
4.     	f10-b10     	f7-f10    
5.     	k9-f9xf10     	h6-h9
4/ Open the .txt file in Fritjof. The conversion to .hntf format is done automatically when you save your game reviewed with Fritjof.

All in-app commands are described when clicking the "help" button.

If the board does not display the variation correctly, it may be due to a display bug: reloading the file may help.
